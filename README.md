## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a Full Stack Developer and Data Analyst with experience in building responsive web applications and interactive dashboards.

On the development side, I work with Django, Python, and modern frontend technologies to build complete web applications.

On the data side, I work with Advanced Excel, Power BI, MySQL, and Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Currently, I am learning Tableau and expanding my knowledge in Data Modeling and Data Science concepts.

Currently building and enhancing:
- ⭐ Star Schema Data Model Dashboard

My goal is to grow equally in both Full Stack Development and Data Analytics.
